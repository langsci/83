% CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
Yauyos is a critically endangered\footnote{At the date of this writing, Yauyos is still classed as ``critically endangered'' by the United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organization \citep{UNESCO}.\index[aut]{UNESCO} The 18th edition of \underline{\smash{Ethnologue}} \citep{ethnologue}\index[aut]{Ethnologue}\index[aut]{Lewis, M. Paul}, however, tags it as ``moribund.'' Although, as I see it, there is no real likelihood that any dialect of Yauyos will ever be revived, it is early yet to declare it moribund, and it is not critically endangered, as the UNESCO defines that standard. The oldest generation to speak it is not that of the grandparents, for example: I estimate that there are about twenty teens who understand the Vi\~nac and San Pedro dialects, as well as many as 80 adults in their forties and fifties who can still speak it relatively fluently. Moreover, although its use is now generally restricted to the discussion of every-day and ritual activities, it is still used frequently among the oldest speakers.} Quechuan language spoken in the Province of Yauyos, Department of Lima, Peru.\footnote{Cacra, Hongos, Tana, and Lincha are all located in the valley created by the Cacra River and its principal tributaries, the Lincha and Paluche Rivers; Apur\'i, Made\'an, Vi\~nac, Az\'angaro, Chocos, and Huang\'ascar are all located in the valley created by the Huang\'ascar River and its principal tributary, the Vi\~nac River. The two valleys are separated by a chain of (rather high and rocky) hills. Running from east to west, these are the cerros Pishqullay, Tinco, Punta Tacana, Ranraorqo, Pishunco, Cochapata, Yanaorqo, and Shallalli. No district is located more than one day's walk from any other; in the case of San Pedro it is two. It is not irrelevant to the explanation of the dialect cleavages that this mountain range seems to block the movement of brides from one set of districts to another. Until very recently, newlywed women generally only moved from one town to another within the same valley. There exists a series of topographical maps prepared and published in 1996 by the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency. Southern Yauyos is covered on the section labeled Tupe\index[sub]{Tupe} and identified Series 1745, Sheet J632, Edition -1 DMA. The map centers the the four districts that lie within the province of Yauyos at about $12^\circ62'$S and $75^\circ7'$W; it places the principal towns of all the districts except Chocos, Huang\'ascar, and Tana at altitudes around 3300 meters. The relevant region can be contained within an area of 40m$^2$; its highest peak reaches 5055m.} The language counts eight dialects. At the time I undertook my research in the area, three of these had already become extinct. The missing dialects are those formerly spoken in the north of the province.\footnote{A ten-day town-to-town search undertaken in the north of the province in January 2010 failed to turn up any speakers of Yauyos Quechua (although some speakers of the Quechua of neighboring Huancayo were indeed to be found).} This grammar, therefore, unfortunately, covers only the five southern dialects. For this reason, I will be referring to it from this point forward as ``Southern Yauyos Quechua,'' abbreviated ``\SYQ{}.''\footnote{The lacuna is highly relevant to any conclusions that might be drawn from this study and, in particular, to any conclusions that might be drawn with regard to its significance for the classification of the Quechuan languages, as two of the missing three -- Alis/Tomas and Huancaya/Vitis -- were those that, according to previous work \citep{Taylor94a,Taylor00},\index[aut]{Taylor, Gerald} most resembled the QII languages of Central Peru.}

The remainder of this introduction begins with a note to Quechuanists (\S~\ref{sec:notetoquechuanists}). The note is followed in \S~\ref{sec:dialectsofyauyos} and~\ref{sec:classification} by a brief discussion of the internal divisions among the various dialects of Yauyos and then a slightly longer discussion of the language's classification. \S~\ref{sec:brin} suggests areas of potential interest for non-Quechuanists. The endangerment of the language is the topic of \S~\ref{sec:endangerment}. \S~\ref{sec:documentation} catalogues the previous research on the language. \S~\ref{sec:fieldwork} supplies details about the fieldwork on which this study is based. Finally, the conventions employed in this volume can be found in \S~\ref{sec:presentation}.

\section{A Note to Quechuanists and Typologists}\label{sec:notetoquechuanists} 
Those already familiar with Quechuan languages will likely be interested in the sections and tables listed immediately below. These indicate differences between Southern Yauyos Quechua and other Quechuan languages as well as differences among the various dialects of \SYQ{}. The footnotes appearing in these sections may be of interest as well. Those familiar with the literature on Quechuan language will immediately recognize the presentation and analysis here as very much derivative of much previous work on those languages.\\

\section{The Dialects of Yauyos}\label{sec:dialectsofyauyos}
Yauyos groups together various dialects that, although mutually intelligible, differ in ways that are relevant both to the classification of Yauyos as well as to the current paradigm for the classification of the Quechuan languages generally. That classification is highly contested, and, indeed, has been since early versions of it were suggested in the 1960s \citep[See in particular][]{Landerman91}.\index[aut]{Landerman, Peter}

The Province is located on the border between the two large, contiguous zones where languages belonging to the two great branches of the Quechua language family are spoken: the ``Quechua I'' (Torero)\index[aut]{Torero, Alfredo} or ``Quechua B'' (Parker)\index[aut]{Parker, Gary J.} languages are spoken to its north; the ``Quechua~II'' or ``Quechua~A'' languages, to its south.

For reasons detailed in \S~\ref{sec:classification}, the model that divides the Quechuan family tree into two principal branches doesn't apply very well to Yauyos, as its different dialects manifest different characteristics of both of branches.\footnote{Yauyos is, of course, not alone in this, not in the least because the division of the languages into two branches was, arguably, based on rather arbitrary criteria in the first place \citep[See in particular][]{Landerman91}.\index[aut]{Landerman, Peter} The significance of Yauyos lies in the fact that it may represent the ``missing link'' between the two \citep[See in particular][]{Heggarty07}\index[aut]{Heggarty, Paul}}. There exist three proposals in the literature  -- \citet{Taylor00,Torero74,ethnologue}\index[aut]{Taylor, Gerald}\index[aut]{Torero, Alfredo}\index[aut]{Lewis, M. Paul} -- with regard to the grouping of the province's fifteen districts into dialect bundles. \citet[105]{Taylor00}\index[aut]{Taylor, Gerald} counts seven varieties of Yauyos Quechua, dividing these into two groups along a north-south axis. In the north are the dialects of Alis/Tomas, Huancaya/Vitis, and Laraos; in the south, those of Apur\'i/Chocos/Made\'an/Vi\~nac, Az\'angaro/Huang\'ascar, Cacra/Hongos, and Lincha/Tana. Taylor classes four of these dialects -- the northern dialects of Alis/Tomas\index[sub]{Alis}\index[sub]{Tomas} and Huancaya/Vitis\index[sub]{Huancaya}\index[sub]{Vitis} and the southern dialects of Az\'angaro/Huang\'ascar\index[sub]{Az\'angaro}\index[sub]{Huang\'ascar} and Cacra/Hongos\index[sub]{Cacra}\index[sub]{Hongos} -- as belonging to the \QI{} branch; he classes the remaining three -- Laraos\index[sub]{Laraos} in the north as well as Apur\'i/Cho\-cos/Made\'an/V\'i\~nac\index[sub]{Apur\'i}\index[sub]{Cho\-cos}\index[sub]{Made\'an}\index[sub]{V\'i\~nac} and Lincha/Tana\index[sub]{Lincha}\index[sub]{Tana} in the south -- as belonging to \QII{}. \citet{Torero74}\index[aut]{Torero, Alfredo} counted only six dialects, excluding Az\'angaro/Huang\'ascar\index[sub]{Az\'angaro}\index[sub]{Huang\'ascar} from the catalogue, classing it independently among the \QI{} dialects along with with Chincha's Topar\'a\index[sub]{Topar\'a}.  Ethnologue, like Taylor, includes Az\'angaro/Huangascar and adds, even, an eighth dialect, that of San Pedro de Huacarpana, spoken on the Chincha side of the Yauyos-Chincha border. Ethnologue further differs from Taylor in putting Apur\'i in a group by itself; and it differs from both Taylor and Torero in grouping Chocos with Az\'angaro/Huang\'ascar. My research supports Taylor's grouping of Apur\'i with Made\'an and Vi\~nac; it also supports Ethnologue's inclusion of San Pedro de Huacarpana\footnote{San Pedro is located immediately to the north-east of Made\'an and Az\'angaro, at less than a days' walk's distance. Although formerly counted a part of the Department of Lima and the Province of Yauyos, a redrawing of political boundaries placed San Pedro on the Ica side of the contemporary Ica-Lima border. During the colonial period, the Province of Yauyos was larger and included parts of what are now the Provinces of Chincha and Castrovirreyna (Huancavelica) \citet[1.1.3.2.7]{Landerman91}\index[aut]{Landerman, Peter N.}.} among the dialects of Yauyos. Apur\'i, like its neighbors Vi\~nac and Made\'an, uses \phono{-ni} and \phono{-y} to indicate the first-person singular in the verbal and substantive paradigms; they also use \phono{-rqa} and \phono{-sa} to indicate the past tense and perfect. The first pair of characteristics set the Made\'an/Vi\~nac and Lincha/Tana dialects apart from the other three; the second pair of characteristics sets Made\'an/Vi\~nac apart from Lincha/Tana. Chocos, like its neighbors Huang\'ascar and Az\'angaro, uses vowel length to indicate the first-person singular in the verbal and substantive paradigms.

\section{Classification}\label{sec:classification}\index[sub]{classification}
Yauyos Quechua was dubbed by Alfredo Torero (\citeyear{Torero74})\index[aut]{Torero, Alfredo} a ``supralect'' and its most careful student, Gerald Taylor,\index[aut]{Taylor, Gerald} referred to it as a ``mixed'' language (\citealt[2]{Taylor90}, \citealt[105]{Taylor00}). Indeed, the designation of Yauyos as a language may seem, at first, to be no more than a relic of the first classifications of the Quechuan languages not by strictly linguistic criteria but, rather, by geographic criteria. Yauyos is located on the border between the two large, contiguous zones where the languages of the two different branches of the Quechuan language family are spoken. \QI{} is spoken immediately to the north, in the Department of Jun\'in and the north of the Department of Lima; \QII{}, immediately to the south, in the Departments of Huancavelica and Ayacucho. Yauyos manifests characteristics of both branches. Take first-person marking. Three dialects, Az\'angaro-Chocos\footnote{I am very grateful to Peter Landerman for correcting me with regard to the classification of Chocos, which I had originally misclassified with Made\'an and Vi\~nac.}-Huang\'ascar~(\ACH{}), Cacra-Hongos (\CH{}), and San Pedro~(\SP{}), use the same marking~(vowel length) for the first person in both nominal and verbal paradigms\footnote{Crucially, vowel length is not distinctive anywhere else in the grammar or lexicon of these dialects. For example, these dialects use the \QII{}~\phono{-naya},~\phono{-raya}, and~\phono{-paya}, not the \QI{}~\phono{-na:},~\phono{-ra:}, and~\phono{-pa:} to mark the desiderative, passive, and continuative, respectively. And all districts but Cacra use~\phono{tiya-}, not~\phono{ta:-} `sit', again sorting with the \QII{} languages.} and mark the first-person object with~\phono{-ma}. These are the two characteristics that define a Quechuan language as belonging to the \QI{}~(also called Quechua B or~\textit{Huaihuash}) branch. The other two dialects, Apur\'i-Made\'an-Vi\~nac~(\AMV{}) and Lincha-Tana~(\LT{}), mark the first person differently in the nominal and verbal paradigms~(with~\phono{-y} and~\phono{-ni}, respectively) and mark first-person object with~\phono{-wa}. These two dialects, then, sort with the \QII{}~(A/\textit{Huampuy})\index[sub]{Huampuy} languages. Indeed, the first three are classed as \QI{}~(specifically, Central\textit{-Huancay}) and the other two, \QII{}~(specifically~\textit{Yunagay}-Central) \citep[247]{CerroP87}.\index[aut]{Cerr\'on-Palomino, Rodolfo M.} Nevertheless, the ``\QI{}'' dialects, \ACH{}, \CH{}, and \SP{}, manifest few of the other traits that set the \QI{} languages apart from the \QII{} languages. They do use~\phono{\~nuqakuna}\index[sub]{nuqakuna@\~nuqakuna} in place of \phononb{\~nuqayku}\index[sub]{nuqayku@\~nuqayku} to form the first person plural exclusive as well as~\phono{-pa(:)ku} to indicate the plural. Crucially, however, so do both the ``\QII{}'' \SYQ{} dialects.\footnote{The \CH{} dialect is unique in using~\phono{-traw} in alternation with both~\phono{-pi} and~\phono{-pa} for the locative.} And none of the five manifest any other of the principal traits that generally set the \QI{} languages apart from the rest. None use~\phono{-naw} in place of~\phono{-Sina} to form the comparative,~\phono{-piqta} in place of~\phono{-manta} to form the ablative, or~\phono{-naq }in place of~\phono{-shqa} to form the narrative past; and none except for Cacra uses~\phono{-r} (realized \textipa{[l]}) in place of~\phono{-shpa} to form same-subject subordinate clauses. Now, the two ``\QII{}'' \SYQ{} dialects manifest several of the traits that set the \QIIC{}~(\textit{Ch\'inchay Meridional}) languages apart from the rest. Like the \QIIC{} languages, the \AMV{} and \LT{} dialects use the diminutive~\phono{-cha}, the emphatic~\phono{-ari}, the assertive~\phono{-puni}, and the alternative conditional~\phono{-chuwan}; the \AMV{} dialect additionally uses the alternative conditional~\phono{-waq.} Crucially, however, the three ``\QI{}'' \SYQ{} dialects, too, use three of these:~\phono{-cha},~\phono{-ari} and~\phono{-chuwan}. Further, all five share with Ayacucho Q the unique use of the evidential modifier~\phono{-ki}. None of the five manifest any of the other defining traits of the \QIIC{} languages: none uses~\phono{-ku} to indicate the first-person plural exclusive or the third-person plural; nor does any use~\phono{-chka}\footnote{Although all use~\phono{-chka}, unproductively except in \SP{}, to indicate simultaneous action that persists in time.} to form the progressive or~\phono{-nka} to form the distributive. Further, none suffered the fusion of \textipa{*/tr/} with \textipa{*/ch/} or \textipa{*/sh/} with \textipa{*/s/}. (See \citet[226--248]{CerroP87} on the defining characteristics of the various Quechuan languages)\index[aut]{Cerr\'on-Palomino, Rodolfo M.} Rather, the dialects of Southern Yauyos are mutually intelligible, and they together share characteristics that set them apart from all the other Quechuan languages. With the single exception that \textsc{\CH{}} uses the accusative form~\phono{-Kta} in place of~\phono{-ta}, all five dialects employ the same case system, which includes the unique ablative form~\phono{-paq} and unique locative \phono{-pi}. All dialects use the progressive form~\phono{-ya};\footnote{One of many attested reductions from *-\phono{yka}: (\phono{-yka:}, \phono{-yka}, \phono{-yga}, \phono{-ycha:}, \phono{-yya:}, \phono{-yya-}, \phono{-ya:}, and \phono{-ya}) \citep[213--219, 260--268, 290]{Hintz}. I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out to me.} all employ the plural~\phono{-kuna} with non-exhaustive meaning; and all employ the same unique system of evidential modification~(see \S~\ref{ssec:evidmodifi}). Further, with a single exception,\footnote{In the \CH{} dialect, as in neighboring Jun\'in, the protomorphemes \textipa{*/r/}, \textipa{*/s/}, and \textipa{*/h/}  are sometimes realized as \textipa{[l]}, \textipa{[h]}, and \textipa{[sh]}, repectively. I have no explanation for why these alternations occur in some cases but not in others. Indeed, it may be the case that where \CH{} differs from the rest of the dialects in that it employs \textipa{*/sh/}where they employ \textipa{*/h/, it is the former that preserves the original form.}} the five dialects are uniform phonologically, all employing a highly conservative system\footnote{An anonymous reviewer points out that other Quechuan languages, Corongo among them, for example, are more conservative than Yauyos with respect to some features, including the preservation of the protoform *\~n in *\~ni- 'say' and \~na:-\~na 'right now'. Sihuas, too, preserves elements of proto Quechua not found in Yauyos. In contrast, while Yauyos preserves a few proto-Quechua features not found in either Corongo or Sihuas, it also manifests others that reflect innovations likely adopted from neighboring QII languages.} that retains all those phonemes hypothesized by Parker and Cerr\'on-Palomino to have been included in the Proto-Quechua (see \S~\ref{sec:phoinvmor}). Table~\ref{Tab1}, below, summarizes this information. Please note that the table presents a somewhat idealized portrait and that the characteristics it posits as belonging exclusively to \QII{} may sometimes be found in \QI{} languages as well. Exceptions of which I am aware are signaled in notes to the table.

The case of Az\'angaro-Chocos-Huang\'ascar requires particular attention in this context. Torero (\citeyear{Torero68}:~293, \citeyear{Torero74}:~28--29)\index[aut]{Torero, Alfredo} classified Az\'angaro and Huang\'ascar as forming an independent group with Topar\'a\index[sub]{Topar\'a} (Chav\'in)\index[sub]{Chav\'in}, placing it among the \QI{} \phono{Huancay} languages. \citet[236]{CerroP87},\index[aut]{Cerr\'on-Palomino, Rodolfo M.} following Torero, cites five criteria for grouping Huang\'ascar with Topar\'a. Both dialects, he writes, use \phono{-pa:ku} and~\phono{-:ri} to indicate the plural; both use~\phono{-shpa} in place of~\phono{-r} to form same-subject subordinate clauses; and both use~\phono{-tamu} to indicate completed action; the two dialects, further, are alike in using unusual locative and ablative case-marking. Only three of these claims are accurate. First, Huang\'ascar, as \citet{Taylor84}\index[aut]{Taylor, Gerald} already indicated, does not use~\phono{-:ri}. Second, Huang\'ascar and Topar\'a may indeed both use unusual locative and ablative case marking, but, crucially, they do not use the same unusual case marking: Huang\'ascar uses~\phono{-pa} to indicate the locative while Topar\'a uses~\phono{-man}; Huang\'ascar uses~\phono{-paq} to indicate the ablative while Topar\'a uses~\phono{-pa}~(C.-P. himself points out these last two facts). Huang\'ascar does indeed use~\phono{-shpa} to form subordinate clauses and~\phono{-tamu} to indicate irreversible change. Crucially, however, so do all the dialects of southern Yauyos. In sum, there is no basis for grouping Huang\'ascar with Topar\'a and not with the other dialects of \SYQ{}. Torero's data were never corroborated; indeed, the findings of Taylor and Landerman, the scholars who have most thoroughly studied Yauyos before now,\footnote{An anonymous reviewer points out that Martha Hardman, Steve Echerd, Rick Floyd, Conrad Phelps -- in addition to several students from Universidad San Marcos -- have given Yauyos extensive attention, although they may not have added to the storehouse of data on the language.} contradict those of Torero.

\SYQ{} is not a jumble of dialects that, were it not for geographical accident, would not be classed together; it is, rather, a unique, largely uniform language. Although I myself do not believe that the current paradigm can be maintained, I have tried to present the data in a way that remains as neutral as possible with regard to the question of how the internal diversity within the Quechuan language family is best characterized, and, in particular, with regard to the question of whether or not the various Quechuan languages are helpfully construed as belonging to one or the other of two branches of a family tree \citep[See in particular][]{Adelaar08}.\index[aut]{Adelaar, Willem F. H.} I leave it to other scholars to interpret the data as they see fit. That said, as long as it is maintained, the current paradigm should be revised to more accurately reflect the relationships of \SYQ{} with/to the languages currently named on the Quechuan family tree as it is currently drawn. That tree groups nine of the eleven districts of southern Yauyos into five sets, assigning each of these sets the status of an independent language. Moreover, two of these sets are actually singletons, as Chocos is listed independent of \mbox{(Az\'angaro-)}Hu'ang\'ascar, to which it is identical, and Apur\'i is listed independent of Made\'an(-Vi\~nac), to which it is identical. (Cacra-Hongos, the set that would deserve independent placement, if any did, appears nowhere at all). The fact that all these ``languages'' are completely mutually intelligible does not justify this. It further seems unjustified to place the Quechua of single villages on the level of that of whole nations -- Bolivia and Ecuador. I suggest, therefore, that Chocos be joined with \mbox{(Az\'angaro-)}Huang\'ascar, and Apur\'i with Made\'an(-Vi\~nac). The first of these new triplets, Az\'ngaro-Chocos-Hunag\'ascar, should be mutated to join the other ``languages'' of southern Yauyos, under the category \textit{Central Yungay}. The four sets should, further, be collapsed and the resulting set called \textit{Southern Yauyos}. The revised (pruned) tree would then be as in Figure~\ref{Fig1rev}. In the event that it be necessary to honor the internal diversity that would be obscured by this move, note may simply be made to the fact that this ``new'' language counts multiple dialects. In this case, Cacra-Hongos and San Pedro de Huacarpana would have to be listed among these.\footnote{I regret having to list Laraos independently here, as I believe it is possible to make a convincing argument for its inclusion as a dialect of Southern Yauyos. Nothing in this volume, however, directly speaks to that question. I plan to address it explicitly in a future paper.}

\section{Broader interest}\label{sec:brin}
Yauyos should be of particular interest to semanticists as well as to students of language contact. Semanticists may find the language's unusual evidential system of interest, while students of language contact may want to look for evidence of contact between the districts where Yauyos is spoken -- that of Cacra-Hongos in particular -- with the three Aymaran-speaking districts in the same region of the province.

\subsection{Semantics -- Evidentials}
For typologists and semanticists, Yauyos' evidential system should be of interest. Evidentials, broadly speaking, are generally said to indicate the type of the speaker's source of information. \SYQ{}, like most other Quechuan languages, employs a three-term system,\footnote{An anonymous reviewer points out that South Conchucos has a 5-choice evidential system, and Sihuas a 6-choice system \citep{Hintz14}\index[aut]{Hintz, Daniel}, while Huallaga has a 4-choice system \citep{Weber89}.\index[aut]{Weber, David John}} indicating direct, reportative, and inferred evidence~(\ie{} the speaker has personal-experience evidence for~\phono{P}, the speaker has non-personal-experience evidence for~\phono{P}, or the speaker infers~\phono{P} based on either personal- or non-personal-experience evidence). In \SYQ{}, the three evidentials are realized~\phono{-mI}, \phono{-shI}, and~\phono{-trI} (See \citet{Floyd99} on Wanka Quechua; \citet{Faller03} on Cuzco Quechua).\index[aut]{Floyd, Rick}\index[aut]{Faller, Martina} The evidential system of \SYQ{} is of particular interest because it employs a second three-term system of evidential modifiers. The evidential system of \SYQ{} thus counts nine members:~\phono{-mI},~\phono{-mik}, and~\phono{-miki};~\phono{-shI},~\phono{-shik}, and~\phono{-shiki}; and~\phono{-trI},~\phono{-trik}, and~\phono{-triki}. The~\phono{-I}~\phono{-ik}, and~\phono{-iki} forms are not allomorphs: they receive different interpretations. \S~\ref{ssec:evidence} describes this system in detail. (For further formal analysis, see \citealt{Shimelman12} and \citealt{Shimelman14}\index[aut]{Shimelman, Aviva}).

\subsection{Language contact -- Aymara}
For students of language contact, it is the contact of Yauyos with Aymara\index[sub]{Aymara} that should be of particular interest.\footnote{Contact of Quechuan languages with Spanish, of course, is of interest here, as it is in all Quechuan languages.} The northern branch of the Aymara family is situated entirely in the province of Yauyos \citep[173]{Adelaar04}\index[aut]{Adelaar, Willem F. H.}\index[aut]{Muysken, Pieter C.}: the Aymaran languages Kawki and Jaqaru\index[sub]{Jaqaru} are spoken in the central Yauyos municipalities of Cachuy\index[sub]{Cachuy}, Aysa\index[sub]{Aysa} and Tupe\index[sub]{Tupe}. There are, further, reports dating from the beginning of the~20th century of other Aymaran-speaking communities in the province~(174).\footnote{On Aymara and the relationship of Quechua and Aymara see, among others, Adelaar with Muysken~(\citeyear{Adelaar04}:~259--317)\index[aut]{Adelaar, Willem F. H.}\index[aut]{Muysken, Pieter C.} and \citet{CerroP94,CerroP00}.\index[aut]{Cerr\'on-Palomino, Rodolfo M.} On Jaqaru, see, among others, \citet{Hardman66,Hardman83,Hardman00}.\index[aut]{Hardman, Martha J.}} I was unable to find evidence of any unusual lexical borrowing in Yauyos, i.e., of words -- like (\textit{pampa-} `bury') -- not also attested in other Quechuan languages. That said, the lexicon I assembled includes only 2000 words, in large part because the vocabulary of the language has been much-reduced, as is to be expected, given that such reduction is one of the symptoms of extreme language endangerment. Those more familiar with the Aymaran languages may, however, still be able to find evidence of calquing or structural influence.

\section{Endangerment}\label{sec:endangerment}
At the date of this writing, the UNESCO\index[aut]{UNESCO} classifies Yauyos as critically endangered\index[sub]{endangerment}, and LinguistList identifies it as near extinct (\url{http://multitree.linguistlist.org/trees/10504@124926}). The 1993 Peru census counted~1,600 speakers,\footnote{That census did not distinguish between speakers of Yauyos and speakers of other Quechuan languages who resided in the province~(Chirinos-Rivera, p.c.). This is crucial in assessing the data on the Quechua-speaking population of the north of the province. Although there are many Quechua-speaking migrants there -- principally from Huancayo, the town with which the north has the most commercial contact -- I was unable to locate any speakers of the dialects indigenous to the area. Further, population data in the province tend to be exaggerated for several reasons. First, people who emigrated from the region years or even decades ago remain, nevertheless, officially resident there for reasons of convenience. Second, death certificates are often not issued for the deceased, as the personnel at the local health clinics simply refuse to issue them.}~25\%{} of them over~65 \citep[121]{Chirinos01}.\index[aut]{Chirinos-Rivera, Andr\'es} Less than ten years before that survey -- still, to my knowledge, the most recent -- electricity had yet to come to the Andean towns of southern Yauyos and the only physical connections between those towns to the rest of the world were three~40-kilometer dirt paths that wound their perilous way~2,000 meters down the canyon. Since that time, the Peruvian government has installed electricity in the region and widened the perilous dirt paths into perilous dirt roads.\footnote{In the space of just one year, spanning~2012 and~2013, fourteen people died in six separate accidents in the region when their vehicles fell from the road down the canyon.} TelMex and Claro now offer cable television, and buses come and go on alternate days. In short, the isolation that had previously preserved the Quechua spoken in the region has been broken and the language now counts, according to my estimates, fewer than~450 speakers, most over~65, and all but the most elderly fully bilingual in Spanish. 

The drastic reduction in the number of speakers can also be attributed to the Shining Path\index[sub]{Shining Path}. During the~1980's and early~1990's, the period during which the Maoist army terrorized the region, there was a large-scale exodus, particularly of young people, who ran to escape forced conscription. Many never returned, remaining principally in the coastal cities of Ca\~nete and Lima. Theirs was the last generation to learn Quechua to any degree. Currently, there are a few children -- those who live with their grandmothers or great-grandmothers in the most isolated hamlets -- with a passive knowledge of the language. The youngest speakers, however, are in their late thirties.

Quechuan as a language family is not currently endangered, and other Quechuan languages are well-documented. Estimates of the numbers of Quechuan speakers range between~8.5 and~10 million, and, although Quechua is being pushed back by Spanish in many areas, the majority dialects of its major varieties -- Ancash, Ayacucho, Bolivian, Cuzco, Ecuadorian\footnote{It is worth noting that much of the diversity internal to these languages is being lost, as one anonymous reviewer points out.} -- are quite viable \citep[168]{Adelaar04}.\index[aut]{Adelaar, Willem F. H.}\index[aut]{Muysken, Pieter C.} Paradoxically, however, the viability of the major varieties is coming at the expense of the viability of the minor varieties. \citet[14]{Adelaar08}\index[aut]{Adelaar, Willem F. H.} writes: ``If Quechua will survive, its speakers will probably be users of four of five of the most successful dialects, most of which belong to Quechua IIB and IIC.'' The dialects of southern Yauyos, classified as either \QI{} or \QIIA, and other minor Quechuan languages are rapidly disappearing.

\section{Existing documentation } \label{sec:documentation}
\citet{Echerd74}\index[aut]{Echerd, Stephen M.} and \citet{Brougere92}\index[aut]{Broug\`ere, Anne-Marie} supply some socio-linguistic data on Yauyos. There is also a book of folktales, in Spanish, collected in the region in the~1930's and~1940's: \emph{Apuntes para el folklor de Yauyos} \citep{Varilla}.\index[aut]{Varilla Gallardo, Br\'igido} Yauyos is mentioned in the context of two dialectological studies of Quechua by \citet{Torero68,Torero74}\index[aut]{Torero, Alfredo}.

With these exceptions, all that is known about Yauyos we owe to the French researcher Gerald Taylor.\index[aut]{Taylor, Gerald} Taylor's PhD dissertation describes the morphology of Laraos, a northern dialect of Yauyos. This work was republished or excerpted, sometimes with revisions, in \citet{Taylor84,Taylor90,Taylor94a,Taylor94b}. \citet{Taylor87a} supplements the data on Laraos with data on Huancaya, and
\citet{Taylor90,Taylor00} provides a comparison of all seven dialects on the basis of eight grammatical elements and fifty lexical items. Finally, \citet{Taylor87b,Taylor87c,Taylor91} transcribes and translates several folktales into Spanish and French.

\section{Fieldwork} \label{sec:fieldwork}
The fieldwork upon which this document is based was conducted in June and July of~2010; January through April~2011; August through December~2011; April through September~2012; and for a total of~10 months between October~2012 and July~2014. The second of these trips was funded by a faculty development grant from San Jos\'e State University; the third through sixth, by two National Endowment for the Humanities-National Science Foundation Documenting Endangered Languages fellowships~(FN-50099-11 and FN-50109-12).

The corpus counts 206 distinct audio and audio-video recordings. The recordings\index[sub]{recordings}, totaling over~71 hours, were made in the seven districts of Southern Yauyos -- Apur\'i, Az\'angaro, Cacra, Chocos, Hongos, Hu\-ang\'ascar, Lincha, Made\'an, and Vi\~nac -- as well as in the district of San Pedro de Huacarpana in Chincha. Recordings include stories, songs, riddles, spontaneous dialogue, personal narrative, and descriptions of traditional activities, crafts and healing practices. Over~28 hours of recordings were transcribed, translated and glossed. The recordings as well as the ELAN time-aligned transcriptions and accompanying videos are archived both at The DoBeS project\index[sub]{DoBeS}, housed at the Max Planck Institute in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, and at the Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America at the University of Texas, Austin, USA. All materials can be accessed via those institutions' websites, \url{http://www.mpi.nl/DOBES/} and \url{http://www.ailla.utexas.org/}. The more popular video recordings -- many transcribed -- can also be easily accessed via \url{endangeredlanguages.com}. All examples that follow except those noted \dag{} were taken from this corpus. It is my hope that these examples will give the reader a sense of the life that supported and was supported by the language. 

Unicode was used for character encoding; audio and video recordings were saved in the standard formats -- PCM \textrm{wav}~44.1/32 bits, \textrm{.mpg}, and \textrm{.mpeg}; unstructured texts were saved as plain text; structured texts have XML-based underlying schemas. Recording equipment includes a Marantz PMD~660 solid state digital audio recorder~(pre-January~2013 recordings); a Roland~R-26 solid state audio recorder; an AudioTechnica~831b cardioid condenser microphone~(pre-May~2012 recordings); a Sennheiser MKH~8060 cardioid condenser microphone; and a Canon Vixia HF S100 HD flash memory camcorder. Transcriptions, translations and glosses were prepared with ELAN; Audacity was used for editing audio recordings; iMovie for video recordings. All work was done on a MacBook Pro~(pre-July~2011 recordings) or MacBook Air~(post-July~2011 recordings). 

Exactly one hundred participants\index[sub]{participants} contributed recordings. Their names are listed below. Dialects are bolded; municipalities, underlined; towns, italicized; annexes, indented. Alphabetical order is preserved throughout. Three participants requested to remain anonymous. In these cases, I have assigned ``pseudo-initials.'' I lost my metadata on three participants. In these cases, they are identified by their intials~(included in the original recording titles) alone.\\

\section{Presentation}\label{sec:presentation}
To facilitate comparison with other Quechuan languages, the presentation here follows the structure of the six Quechua grammars published by the Peruvian government in~1976. Readers familiar with those grammars will note the obvious debt this one owes to those: it follows not just their format, but also, in large part, their analysis. The six~1976 grammars cover the Quechuas of Ancash, Ayacucho, Cajamarca, Cuzco, Huanca and San Mart\'in \citep{Parker76gram,Soto76a,Quesada76,Cusihuaman76,CerroP76a,Coombs76}.\index[aut]{Parker, Gary J.}\index[aut]{Soto Ruiz, Clodoaldo}\index[aut]{Quesada Castillo, F\'elix}\index[aut]{Cusihuam\'an Guti\'errez, Antonio}\index[aut]{Cerr\'on-Palomino, Rodolfo M.}\index[aut]{Coombs, David}\index[aut]{Coombs, Heidi}\index[aut]{Weber, Robert} Other published grammars of Quechuan languages include \citet{Herrero78}\index[aut]{Herrero, Joaqu\'in}\index[aut]{S\'anchez de Lozada, Federico} on Bolivian; \citet{Catta94}\index[aut]{Catta, Javier} on Ecuatorian; \citet{Taylor94a}\index[aut]{Taylor, Gerald} on Ferre\~nafe; \citet{Weber89}\index[aut]{Weber, David} on Huallaga~(Huanuco);\footnote{Thanks to an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out. \citet{Hintz} supplies a grammar of aspect and related categories in Quechua, especially South Conchucos Quechua (Ancash).} \citet{Cole82}\index[aut]{Cole, Peter} on Imbabura; \citet{Adelaar77}\index[aut]{Adelaar, Willem F. H.} description of Tarma Quechua and his (\citeyear{Adelaar86}) morphology of Pacaraos; 
as well as the surveys and compilations of \citet{CerroP87,CerroP90}\index[aut]{Cerr\'on-Palomino, Rodolfo M.}\index[aut]{Sol\'is-Fonesca, Gustavo}, and \citet{Cole94}\index[aut]{Cole, Peter}\index[aut]{Hermon, Gabriella}\index[aut]{Mart\'in, Mario D.}.

Words and phrases appearing in italics -- \phono{like this} -- are in Quechua. English and Spanish interpretations appear in single quotation marks -- `like this'. Interpretations are sometimes given in Spanish -- the language I used with my consultants\footnote{Indeed, all English glosses are my translations from the Spanish glosses my consultants originally supplied. In most cases, the Spanish translations reflected the syntax and semantics of the original Quechua. I sacrificed this in preparing the the English glosses that appear here. I made this choice because the more literal glosses are standard in Andean Spanish -- in structures like the possessive `su n de a' (`his \lsc{n} of a') -- they would not be standard in any English dialect of which I am aware.} -- as well as English. Transformations (illustrations of changes indicated as a result of morphological processes referenced) are indicated with arrows -- \textit{like} $\rightarrow$ \textit{like\_this}. Quechua words are broken into component morphemes, like this: \phono{warmi-\pb{kuna}}. It is the morpheme relevant to the topic in focus that is underlined. 

Each section and major subsection begins with an account of the topic under consideration. Terminal subsections supply more extended discussion and further examples, generally about 10, often as many as 30 or even 40. All examples except those indicated with a dagger are taken from the corpus of recordings collected during the course of the documentation of the language. Those with a dagger were elicited. The glosses are presented in the following format.\\[1ex]

All examples are taken from the transcribed corpus. Transcriptions can be checked against the original recordings by downloading the compilation of recordings archived with the corpus, typing a couple of words from either the example or its gloss into the search bar and following the recording title and time signature back to the original recording. I am also happy to supply this information. Source titles refer to \textrm{.eaf} files archived with DoBeS\index[sub]{DoBeS} and AILLA\index[sub]{AILLA}. File names include three elements: the place in which the recording was made, the initials of the principal participant, and a word or two recalling the principal topic(s). For example, the file \textrm{Vinac\_JC\_Cure} was made in Vi\~nac, has for its principal participant Jes\'us Centeno and for its principal topic a curing ceremony. Because of restrictions on file names, no accents are used. So, Az\underline{\'a}ngaro is rendered ``Az\underline{a}ngaro'' and so on.

Glosses were prepared in accord with the Leipzig glossing rules. For reasons of space, two deviations from the standard abbreviations were made: ``proximal demonstrative'' is not rendered ``\textsc{dem.prox}'' but ``\textsc{dem.p}''; and ``distal demonstrative'' is not rendered ``\textsc{dem.dist}'' but ``\textsc{dem.d}''. Gloss codes are listed with the notational conventions at page~\pageref{ch:notconv}, in the section with that name.
